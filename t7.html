Web Technology refers to the various tools and techniques that are utilized in the process of communication between
different types of devices over the internet. A web browser is used to access web pages. Web browsers can be defined as
programs that display text, data, pictures, animation, and video on the Internet. Hyperlinked resources on the World
Wide Web can be accessed using software interfaces provided by Web browsers.
World Wide Web (WWW): The World Wide Web is based on several different technologies : Web browsers, Hypertext Markup
Language (HTML) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
    </br>
Web Browser: The web browser is an application software to explore www (World Wide Web). It provides an interface
between the server and the client and requests to the server for web documents and services.</br>

Web Server: Web server is a program which processes the network requests of the users and serves them with files that
create web pages. This exchange takes place using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).</br>

Web Pages: A webpage is a digital document that is linked to the World Wide Web and viewable by anyone connected to the
internet has a web browser.</br>

Web Development: Web development refers to the building, creating, and maintaining of websites. It includes aspects such
as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. It is the creation of an application that works
over the internet i.e. websites.</br>

        PHP: PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development. Since PHP code executed on the
        server-side, so it is called a server-side scripting language.
        Node.js: Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside a
        browser. You need to remember that NodeJS is not a framework, and it’s not a programming language. Most people are
        confused and understand it’s a framework or a programming language. We often use Node.js for building back-end services
        like APIs like Web App or Mobile App. It’s used in production by large companies such as Paypal, Uber, Netflix,
        Wallmart, and so on.
        Python: Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.
        Ruby: Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language. Ruby is a pure
        Object-Oriented language developed by Yukihiro Matsumoto. Everything in Ruby is an object except the blocks but there
        are replacements too for it i.e procs and lambda. The objective of Ruby’s development was to make it act as a sensible
        buffer between human programmers and the underlying computing machinery.
        Java: Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages and platforms. It is highly scalable. Java
        components are easily available.
        JavaScript: JavaScript can be used as both (front end and back end) programming.
        Golang: Golang is a procedural and statically typed programming language having the syntax similar to C programming
        language. Sometimes it is termed as Go Programming Language.
        C# :C# is a general-purpose, modern and object-oriented programming language pronounced as “C sharp”.
        DBMS: The software which is used to manage database is called Database Management System (DBMS).
