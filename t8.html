Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group
of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas
among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence
that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a
paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one
sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea. In this handout,
we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.






Despite the fact that piranhas are relatively harmless, many people continue to believe the pervasive myth that piranhas
are dangerous to humans. This impression of piranhas is exacerbated by their mischaracterization in popular media. For
example, the promotional poster for the 1978 horror film Piranha features an oversized piranha poised to bite the leg of
an unsuspecting woman. Such a terrifying representation easily captures the imagination and promotes unnecessary fear.
While the trope of the man-eating piranhas lends excitement to the adventure stories, it bears little resemblance to the
real-life piranha. By paying more attention to fact than fiction, humans may finally be able to let go of this
inaccurate belief.




Imagine each paragraph as a sandwich. The real content of the sandwich—the meat or other filling—is in the middle. It
includes all the evidence you need to make the point. But it gets kind of messy to eat a sandwich without any bread.
Your readers don’t know what to do with all the evidence you’ve given them. So, the top slice of bread (the first
sentence of the paragraph) explains the topic (or controlling idea) of the paragraph. And, the bottom slice (the last
sentence of the paragraph) tells the reader how the paragraph relates to the broader argument. In the original and
revised paragraphs below, notice how a topic sentence expressing the controlling idea tells the reader the point of all
the evidence.


You are probably familiar with the idea that transitions may be needed between paragraphs or sections in a paper (see
our handout on transitions). Sometimes they are also helpful within the body of a single paragraph. Within a paragraph,
transitions are often single words or short phrases that help to establish relationships between ideas and to create a
logical progression of those ideas in a paragraph. This is especially likely to be true within paragraphs that discuss
multiple examples. Let’s take a look at a version of our piranha paragraph that uses transitions to orient the reader:

Although most people consider piranhas to be quite dangerous, they are, except in two main situations, entirely
harmless. Piranhas rarely feed on large animals; they eat smaller fish and aquatic plants. When confronted with humans,
piranhas’ instinct is to flee, not attack. But there are two situations in which a piranha bite is likely. The first is
when a frightened piranha is lifted out of the water—for example, if it has been caught in a fishing net. The second is
when the water level in pools where piranhas are living falls too low. A large number of fish may be trapped in a single
pool, and if they are hungry, they may attack anything that enters the water.
